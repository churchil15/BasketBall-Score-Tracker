# BasketBall-Score-Tracker
Court Counter is a basic android application that can be used to track score (+3, +2, and a free throw) between two teams. 

It uses basic android concepts for user input and handling that input using 
onClick attribute (for a Button View), working with views and positioning them in the layout and the different attributes that 
we are going to use to style this views.
The Score moves up depending on the button that is clicked and after the game we can also reset the score 
to 0 by clicking the reset button. The reintializes the score values to 0 for both the teams.
